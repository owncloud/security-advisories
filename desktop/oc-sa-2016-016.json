    "Description": "<p>The ownCloud Client was vunerable to a local code injection attack. A malicious local user could create a special path where the client would load libraries from during startup. As on Windows, everyone by default has the permission to write to the <code>C:</code> drive and create arbitrary directories and subdirectories, this attack is practically feasible in any non-hardened Windows environment. This could lead to injecting code into other users' ownCloud Client.</p>",
    "ActionTaken": "<p>To protect our users ownCloud has issued the 2.2.3 client which no longer loads code from this location.</p>",
