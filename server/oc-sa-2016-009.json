    "Description": "<p>The external storage functionality as implemented in ownCloud 9.0.x before 9.0.2 is improperly setting up external storages when multiple groups have been granted access to an external storage and a user is member of both groups.</p><p>The storage class is setup without any setup information, leading to multiple issues, including:</p><p>Unavailability of the external storage</p><p>Access to files that are not supposed to be shared (only if the 'Local' storage type is used)</p>",
    "ActionTaken": "The storage code has been reviewed and been patched to properly setup the storage. Furthermore several hardenings have been added to ownCloud which will highly reduce the change of a successful exploitation of similar vulnerabilities in the future.",
