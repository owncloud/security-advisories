  "Description":"<p>The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in ownCloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.</p><p><b>Note:</b>ownCloud employs a very strict Content Security Policy on the DAV endpoints. This is thus only exploitable on browsers that don't support Content Security Policy.</p>",
  "ActionTaken": "The mimetype of the exported image is now compared with a whitelist as well as download disposition headers have been set on the response.",
